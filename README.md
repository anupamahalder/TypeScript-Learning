# TypeScript:
## What TypeScript does?
1. Static Checking
2. Analyze the code as we type.
   
## What is TypeScript?
1. It is a development tool. Your project still runs JS

### NOTE:
1. All files will be inside dist folder as .js and inside src folder there will be .ts 
2. Creating a configuration file for the typescript compiler (on terminal): tsc -- init
3. By default TypeScript uses older version of Javascript ES5
4. To run the all typescript file we will write on terminal: tsc
5. To run a particular file on Terminal: node dist/DataTypes.js

## Datatype in TypeScript:
  Data types that introduces in TypeScript:
  1. any
  2. unknown
  3. never
  4. enum
  5. tuple
### NOTE: 
  1. If we initialize a variable then typescript understand the datatype of that variable so if we donot write the datatype but intialized we can see the datatype whenever we hover on the datatype
  2. If we donot initialize and as well as not mentioning the datatypes the typescript will label it with any datatype.
